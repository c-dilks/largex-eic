# Tutorials

Here is a collection of tutoial macros. If you are learning this software,
it is recommended to go through these tutorials in order given below.

- **Note**: execute macros from the `largex-eic` top directory, not from
this tutorial directory, e.g., `root -b -q tutorial/analysis_template.C`

- you need to generate or obtain ROOT files, from fast or full simulation
  - the `datarec/` directory is provided for storage of these files,
    but is not required to use
  - if you are running in the Singularity container, there are sample
    Delphes output files in `/data`
    - the easiest way to run the tutorial macros is to make symbolic
      links with `ln -sv /data/*.root datarec/`
    - alternatively, pass the file names as parameters when running
      the macros
    - sample files are not up-to-date, and serve as examples only
  - if you want to generate your own, run Pythia8 to produce a `hepmc`
    file, then run Delphes

- many of these examples focus on fast simulations
  - to switch between fast and full simulations, change the Analysis
    class in the macro
    - `AnalysisDelphes` is used for fast simulation
    - `AnalysisDD4hep` is used for full simulation
    - some extra settings and features differ between the two

- all tutorial examples have two macros:
  - analysis macro, to run an `Analysis` class, which will analyze 
    simulated data in an event loop, and generate a variety of output
    data structures
  - postprocessor macro, to process the output from the analysis macro,
    such as drawing plots
  - the analysis macro will take some time to run, since it runs
    the event loop; the postprocessor macro is typically fast, since
    it analyzes the resulting data structures

- in the analysis macros, the input files are specified by a list, with the
  following columns for each file (so that we can combine different Q2 regions
  together using relative weights):
  - file name (relative to the top-level directory, unless you have an
    absolute path)
  - the number of events for the weighting and cross section
    - set to `-1` for all
    - this is not related to `Analysis::maxEvents`, which limits how
      many events to process
  - cross section (can be obtained from Pythia output logs, for example)
  - minimum Q2
  - see files in `../datarec/*.config` for examples
    - the tutorials below use `../datarec/tutorial.config`, which has a
      single file, the aforementioned example ROOT file

## Examples:

1. Template
  - `analysis_template.C`: minimal analysis macro to demonstrate how
    to run `Analysis`; no bins are specified
  - there is no postprocessor macro (see other examples); instead, inspect
    the output root file from the analysis macro, to learn what objects
    are stored

2. (x,Q2) Binning
  - `analysis_xqbins.C`: bin the analysis in a few 2D bins of x and Q2
    - there is a `switch` statement to allow the choice of various
      example binning schemes
    - this example also describes how cuts are defined
  - `postprocess_xqbins_draw.C`: draws a couple sample histograms for
    the given binning scheme

3. Full Simulations (all other tutorials are for fast simulations)
  - `analysis_dd4hep.C`: basically a copy of `analysis_xqbins.C`,
    but shows how to analyze full simulation data; the main difference
    is using `AnalysisDD4hep` instead of `AnalysisDelphes`
  - `postprocess_dd4hep_draw.C`: clone of `postprocess_xqbins_draw.C`,
    specific for this example

4. Average kinematics table
  - `analysis_qbins.C`: bin the analysis in several Q2 bins, for a couple
    pT bins
  - `postprocess_qbins_tables.C`: produce a text file containing tables
    of averages of kinematics variables, where each row is for a Q2 bin;
    one table is produced for each pT bin

5. Draw ratio of histograms for different y-minima
  - `analysis_yRatio.C`: bins in 3 y-minima, along with a full-y bin
  - `postprocess_yRatio.C`: produces ratios of all histograms, with
    a y-minimum divided by no y-minimum

6. Test DAG lambda staging
  - `analysis_testDAG.C`: define multi-dimensional binning
  - `postprocess_testDAG.C`: contains various lambdas examples and
    describes how to stage them

7. Conditional Subloops
  - `analysis_coverage.C`: define 4-D binning scheme, including
    extra "full-range" bins
  - `postprocess_coverage.C`: draw certain plots, while restricting
    certain bins to be "full-range", i.e., "integrated over"; in order
    to restrict the execution of certain subloops, conditional control
    functions are used

More examples will be added eventually; for now you are encouraged to
look at other existing analysis and postprocessor macros
